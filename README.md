# Sally Coding Challenge

Dear Michael,

I thoroughly enjoyed working on the Sally Coding Challenge! This project allowed me to leverage Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a solution that aligns with the requirements of the challenge. The use of these technologies helped in crafting a responsive and visually appealing solution.

I've created a dedicated branch where I completed the challenge after returning home from my shift. You can find it under "completeingChallenge".

## Technologies Used
- Bootstrap
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

I'm looking forward to hearing your feedback and any insights you might have. Thank you for this opportunity, and I'm excited about the prospect of contributing more to the Sally project!

Best regards,
Jeremy Ashley
